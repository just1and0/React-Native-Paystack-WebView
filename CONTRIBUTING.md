# Contribution Guidelines

We’re excited to have you contribute! Here’s how to get started:

## Steps to Contribute

- Fork the Project: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.
- Create a New Branch: For each new feature or change, create a new branch from the `main` branch.
- Make Your Changes.
- Submit a Pull Request (PR): Once you’re satisfied with your changes, submit a PR. Be sure to provide a clear description of what your PR does and the problem it solves.
- Add @just1and0 as a reviewer.

## Important Notes
- All commit titles must begin with either;
  - fix(RNPSW):<title-of-change> : this is a fix PR
  - feat(RNPSW):<title-of-change> : this is a new feature PR
  - perf(RNPSW):<title-of-change> : this is a performance PR
  - BREAKING CHANGE:<title-of-change> : this is a breaking change
- No Build Attempts in PRs: Please do not try to build the project within your PR; our Continuous Integration (CI) system will handle that for you.
- Contributor Recognition: You do not need to add yourself as a contributor; the CI will automatically recognize and credit you once your PR is merged.

Thank you for helping us make this project even better! We appreciate your contributions!
